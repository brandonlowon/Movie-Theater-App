By Brandon Low-on, Brendan Mahler, Khoi Ngo, Kevin Loughery

This project was done in completion for our University course. It simulates the browsing of a movie theater application for phones where a user can browse select movie theaters and movies and reserve seats by purchasing tickets. Additional features include refunding tickets to receive credit, signing up for membership to gain benefits and browse upcoming movies.
